Events in GitHub Actions (Triggers)

---

Definition
In GitHub Actions, an event is something that happens inside GitHub which causes a workflow to start.
Events tell the workflow when it should run.

Every workflow starts with:

```
on:
```

Whatever you write under this section decides the trigger.

---

Types of Events
There are many events.
Below are the most commonly used events in DevOps and CI/CD teaching.

1. push
2. pull_request
3. workflow_dispatch
4. schedule
5. release
6. issues
7. create and delete
8. workflow_run
9. path based triggers
10. tag based triggers
11. multiple events combined

Now each one explained in detail.

---

1. push Event

---

Runs when someone pushes code to a branch.

Example:

```
on: push
```

Runs on all branches.

If you want only main branch:

```
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```

If you want multiple branches:

```
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev
```

Push event runs whenever a commit is pushed.

---

2. pull_request Event

---

Runs when a pull request is created, reopened, or updated.

Example:

```
on: pull_request
```

Runs for all PR branches targeting any branch.

To run only when PR targets main:

```
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
```

Usage:
Testing, linting, security scanning before merging.

---

3. workflow_dispatch Event

---

Used for manual running.
Adds a "Run workflow" button in Actions tab.

```
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

Without this, manual run is not possible.

You can also add inputs:

```
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      username:
        description: "Enter name"
        required: true
```

---

4. schedule Event

---

Used to run workflows on a time schedule (cron jobs).

Example: run every day at midnight.

```
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
```

Example: run every hour

```
cron: "0 * * * *"
```

Usage:
Nightly builds
Daily reports
Automatic backups
Regular health checks

---

5. release Event

---

Runs when a release is created.

```
on:
  release:
    types: [created]
```

Usage:
Packaging
Publishing software
Deploying final artifacts

---

6. issues Event

---

Runs when an issue is opened, edited, or closed.

Example:

```
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
```

Usage:
Auto reply bot
Auto label bot

---

7. create and delete Events

---

Runs when a branch or tag is created or deleted.

Example:

```
on:
  create
```

or

```
on:
  delete
```

Usage:
Notify team when new branch is created
Handle tag creation

---

8. workflow_run Event

---

Triggered after another workflow finishes.

Example:

```
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build"]
    types:
      - completed
```

This runs after the workflow named Build completes.

Usage:
Chaining workflows
Post-deployment tasks

---

9. Path based events

---

Trigger workflow only when specific files are changed.

Example:

```
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "src/**"
```

Runs only if files inside src folder changed.

Exclude paths:

```
on:
  push:
    paths-ignore:
      - "docs/**"
```

Usage:
Run tests only when code changes
Skip workflow when docs change

---

10. Tag based events

---

Trigger on tag creation.

Example:

```
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"
```

Runs when tag starts with v (v1.0, v2.3 etc)

Usage:
Release builds
Version packaging

---

11. Multiple Events Combined

---

You can combine events using list.

Example:

```
on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

Or:

```
on: [push, pull_request]
```

## Complete Workflow Example Using Many Events

```
name: Multi Event Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 5 * * *"
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Triggered workflow"
```

Explanation:
Runs on push to main
Runs on PR to main
Runs manually
Runs every day at 5AM
Runs when a release is created

---

## Simple Final Explanation

Events decide when a workflow will run.
Different events are used for different automation needs.
push and pull_request are the most used.
workflow_dispatch is for manual run.
schedule is for cron jobs.
